# Gen-AI-Analytics

## Overview

The **Gen AI Analytics** tool is designed to democratize data insights across business units, empowering non-technical teams to ask complex business questions, receive instant and accurate insights, eliminate dependency on data teams, and make faster, data-driven decisions.

## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a React-based dashboard prototype that demonstrates query interaction and result visualization for the Gen AI Analytics tool.

## Technical Requirements

### ✅ Single-Page Application (SPA) with:
- Natural language query input
- Query processing simulation
- Result display area with a chart
- Basic state management

## Specific Tasks

### 📚 UI Components
- Query input field with AI-powered suggestions
- Query history section
- Results display with mock data visualization
- Loading and error states

### ⚡ State Management
- Use **Redux** for global state management
- Handle query submission, processing, and result states
- Create actions and reducers for query interactions

## Design Considerations

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Clean, modern interface
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Intuitive and user-friendly experience

## Technical Stack

### 🛠️ Frontend
- **React.js** for dynamic UI
- **Redux** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** or **Material-UI** for styling
- **Optional**: Recharts or Chart.js for data visualization

## Submission Requirements

## Approach Explanation

### 1. 📚 Understanding Requirements  
   I thoroughly reviewed the project requirements and objectives to ensure clarity on the essential functionalities required for the dashboard.

### 2. 🚀 Setting Up the Project  
   I initialized a new React project using Create React App and installed the required dependencies, including Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### 3. 🧩 Component Development  
   - I created reusable UI components such as the query input field, query history section, and results display area.  
   - AI-powered suggestions were simulated using a predefined list of queries to enhance the query input field.

### 4. 🔄 State Management  
   - I set up Redux to manage global application state effectively.  
   - Actions and reducers were created to handle query submissions, processing states, and results, ensuring smooth data flow.

### 5. 📈 Mock Data Visualization  
   - Chart.js was used to visualize query results in a user-friendly format.  
   - Mock data was implemented to simulate realistic query results.

### 6. 📱 Responsive Design  
   - Tailwind CSS utility classes ensured that the dashboard maintains responsiveness across different screen sizes.

### 7. 🧪 Testing and Debugging  
   - Rigorous testing was performed to validate component functionality and ensure a seamless user experience.

### 8. 🌐 Deployment  
   - The application was deployed on Vercel, ensuring easy accessibility for demonstration purposes.

This structured approach enabled me to build a fully functional, responsive, and visually appealing prototype that effectively meets the project requirements.
